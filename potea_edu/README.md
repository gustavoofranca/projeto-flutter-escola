## Atomic Design Implementation

The project implements Atomic Design principles through a structured component hierarchy:

### Atoms
- CustomButton: Reusable button component with multiple variants
- CustomTextField: Form input field with validation and styling
- CustomTypography: Text components with consistent styling

### Molecules
- FormFieldGroup: Group of related form fields
- InfoCard: Information display card with icon and text
- SectionTitle: Section header with title and subtitle

These components are reusable across the application and follow consistent design patterns.
